        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I am trying to learn Javascript. I am doing this website just for fun to learn some things and keep things exciting!
        </p>

        <p>
          My end game goal is to become a fullstack web developer
        </p>

        <p>
          In my free time I love to golf! I often play in tournaments on the weekends. I also love to play video games!
